    <hr>
    <p><strong> Hover over the bolded text.<br><br></strong></p>
    <p>There's two divs on top of each other, both having the same h2 text inside.</p>
    <p>One div has a white background with a black h2 text.<br><br> This is what you see normally.</p>
    <p>It has a z-index of 1 to put it on top.</p><br><br>
    <p>The second div has a black background with a white h2 text.
      <br>This gets revealed when their .decoration div is hovered.</p><br><br>
    <p>I SPECIFICALLY did this so that the animation works even if we're not hovering over the text itself.</p>
    <p>The top-layer div (white bg, black txt) SHRINKS its height so that the bottom layer (black bg, white txt) is
      revealed underneath.</p>
  </div>
