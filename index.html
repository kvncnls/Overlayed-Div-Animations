    <p>There's two divs on top of each other, both having the same h2 text inside.</p>
    <p>One div has a white background with a black h2 text.<br><br> This is what you see normally.</p>
    <p>It has a z-index of 1 to put it on top.</p><br><br>
    <p>The second div has a black background with a white h2 text. <br>This gets revealed on hover.</p><br><br>
    <p>The top-layer div SHRINKS its height so that the bottom layer is revealed underneath</p>
